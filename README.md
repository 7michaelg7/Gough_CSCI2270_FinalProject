## Movie Locator

Find movies near your location.  Search for a movie based off a text file.  The program will display the Title, year, and IMDB rating.  You will then have the option to rent a movie based off your location.  The locations are based on a graph with weighted distances.  A user selects their location and the closest store with the desired DVD will be returned.  Once rented the movie will be removed from that location.  A user can also view the entire inventory.
